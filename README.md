What are the functional testing types?
Ans:
Functional testing is a test that verifies whether each application’s feature  meets the software requirements. Each function is compared to the corresponding requirement whether its output is consistent with the end user’s expectations.
Some common functional testing types include:

•	Unit Test : Detects logical errors in every single module, and checks whether or not the modules function in accordance with predetermined specifications.

•	Integration Test : Tests the interactions between different units or components to ascertain they work together correctly.

•	System Test : Tests on a complete software system to verify that it runs as expected and meets the specified requirements.

•	Acceptance Test : Evaluates the compliance of the system with the business requirements and assess whether it is deliverable or not.

What is risk identification?
Ans:
Risk identification is the process of identifying potential risks that could impact  project objectives. It’s the first step in the risk management process, which is designed to help companies understand and plan for potential risks. By identifying risks early in the project life cycle, appropriate mitigation strategies can be developed to minimize their impact.

What is the difference between automated testing and manual testing?
Ans:
Automated Testing : In automated testing, tests are executed automatically via test automation frameworks, tools and scripts. Investment is required for testing tools. It is efficient for repetitive  tasks, regression testing, tests that require large datasets.

Manual Testing : In manual testing, a human performs the tests step by step, without test scripts. Investment is required for human resources. It is effective for exploratory testing, usability testing, and scenarios where human judgement is required.

That means automated testing is faster than manual testing. Automated testing is more reliable as it uses tools to test. And manual testing is very useful in UI testing.

What is the difference between functional and nonfunctional testing?
Ans:
Functional Testing : It checks apps operations and actions based on business requirement. And it also checks actual vs expected results. Focuses on verifying that the software meets its specifications.

Non-functional Testing : It checks apps based on customer expectations. It also checks response, speed, and other requirements. Focuses on verifying the performance, reliability, usability and other qualities of the software.

Do you think performance testing is important? Why?
Ans:
Yes, performance testing is important because it assesses the speed, responsiveness, and stability of a software program, network, device or web or mobile application under a specific workload. Poor performance can lead to user dissatisfaction, loss of customers, and damage to software reputation. It’s essential to identify and prevent performance issues that might negatively impact user experience and system reliability.
